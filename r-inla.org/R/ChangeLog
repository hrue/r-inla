	I gave up the ChangeLog; will come back to a better system later...

        * This is a major upgrade; we have added support for grouping
          of models, removed many '*x2' and '*x3' models and replaced
          them with a 'copy' feature. Plus a lot of other changes
          which I have forgotten. Hopefully, the help pages at
          r-inla.org will soon be updated to explain these new
          features.

        * The argument `Qmatrix' in the generic model has change name
          to `Cmatrix'. Model `generic' has changed name to
          `generic0'.

        * Added support for replications of models.

        * Added support for different likelihood-families models
          within the same model.

        * Added improved names for argument `strategy' in
          `control.inla()' statement: gaussian, simplified.laplace and
          laplace.

        * The inla-program is now compiled using a version of gcc for
          Windows from www.equation.com where the big change is that
          `...the library to support parallel processing has been
          replaced'.  Further, version gcc-4.5 is now used for both
          Windows and Mac, and version 4.4 for Linux.  OpenMP is now
          enabled by default for Windows; fingers crossed!

        * Added negative binomial likelihood; see the inla-manual for
          details. It is similar to the Poission with an extra
          overdispersion hyperparameter.

        * The family and model names, now ignore `.' and `_' and is
          invariant for case. For example, the negative binomial model
          can be specified as `n_binomial' or `n.binomial' or
          `nbinomial'.

2009-07-10 Havard Rue

        * Added utility for upgrading INLA: ?inla.upgrade

        * Added help-page for global options: ?inla.options

2009-07-09 Havard Rue

        * The CPO calculations int the inla-program have been
          rewritten, with improved detection of imperfect tail
          behaviour.

2009-07-07 Havard Rue

        * Added a tweak to the inla-program so if its detect a better
          mode while computing the Hessian, then it will restart
          computing the Hessian around that point. In effect, this is
          a simple and stupid local search algorithm. For some models
          where the posterior is really flat (and where the default
          optimisation algorithms fails to locate the mode due to
          inaccurate function evalutations), this simple trick solves
          it and locate the mode. Well, at least for my
          test-examples...

2009-07-03 Havard Rue

        * Added help-page for the routines to compute with marginals;
          see ?marginal

2009-06-29 Havard Rue

        * Added new model=BYM; see the manual for details and
          demo(Bym) for an example.

2009-06-18 Havard Rue

        * Added new model=GENERIC1; see the manual for details.
        
        * Renamed model=GENERIC to GENERIC0, but the old name is still
          valid.

2009-06-03 Havard Rue

        * The constr=TRUE|FALSE argument now works for the CRW2
          model. OOPS: The default behaviour has now changed to
          constr=TRUE, which impose a sum-to-zero constraint as it
          should.

        * Added the function inla.group(), which can group covariates,
          like
                 f(inla.group(x), model=\"rw2\")

          Options are number of groups and method; see the help-page
          for details.

2009-05-31 Havard Rue 

        * Make num.threads default to 1 for Windows; the OpenMP
        behaviour is reported to be unstable and sometimes the program
        `just stops'. It's known that the OpenMP for gcc-4.x under
        mingw is `unstable' and kind of `experimental'. If anyone has
        some good ideas how to resolve this issue, please let me know.

        * Added some tests about a valid Qmatrix for model = generic.

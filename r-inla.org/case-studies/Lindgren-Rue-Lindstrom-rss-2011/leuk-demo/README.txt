Unpack, and run

The comments in the code should hopefully explain what the different
parts do, with further explanations below.

You will need the "testing" version of INLA;
 inla.upgrade(testing=TRUE)

The spde/gmrf/inla interface is being updated from the current
(2011-02-16) slightly ad hoc version into something more streamlined,
in particular for plotting.  We will try to keep backwards
compatibility and/or update the contents of this demonstration code.

In the code, element  Q[i,j]  of the precision matrix corresponds to
the link between the weights for triangulation basis nodes  i  and  j
with coordinates stored in   mesh$mesh$s[i,]   and   mesh$mesh$s[j,]

The  mapgrid  variable contains information for mapping between the
triangulation and a dense lattice of points; used in the code for
plotting purposes.
mapgrid$s  are the points, and  mapgrid$A  is a sparse matrix such that

mapgrid$s == mapgrid$A %*% mesh$mesh$s

This means that if you know values,  x, at the mesh vertices, the
lattice interpolated values,  y,  are obtained as

y = mapgrid$A %*% x

Examples of this is in the plotting part of the code.

For each data point,  Leuk$district, is the region index, so that
mesh.district = c()
mesh.district[mesh$locations.idx] = Leuk$district
should give the mesh index mapped to the triangulation vertices.
(Note: In this example, locations.idx  is actually simply  1:n, so this
extra mapping step i unnecessary.)
No such mapping is available for the dense lattice in  mapgrid.

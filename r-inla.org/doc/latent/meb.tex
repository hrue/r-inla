\section*{The Berkson Measurement Error (MEB) model}

\subsection*{Parametrization}

This is an implementation of the Berksom measurement error model for a
fixed effect. The observed covariate is $w$ but it is $x$
that goes into the linear predictor
\begin{displaymath}
    \eta = \ldots + \beta x + \ldots \ ,
\end{displaymath}
where $x = w + u$, $u$ is Gaussian with precision $\tau_u\times s$,
 and $s$ is a vector of fixed scalings. 


\subsection*{Hyperparameters}

This model has 2 hyperparameters, $\theta = (\theta_{1}, \theta_{2})$.
The hyperparameter specification is as follows:
\begin{displaymath}
    \theta_{1} = \beta
\end{displaymath}
and the prior is defined on $\theta_{1}$,
\begin{displaymath}
    \theta_{2} = \log(\tau_u)
\end{displaymath}
and the prior is defined on $\theta_{2}$.

\subsection*{Specification}

The MEB is specified inside the {\tt f()}
function as
\begin{verbatim}
 f(w, [<weights>,] model="meb", hyper = <hyper>, scale = <s>)
\end{verbatim}
Here, \texttt{w} are the observed covariates, and the fixed scaling of
the observational precision is given in argument \texttt{scale}. If
the argument \texttt{scale} is not given, then $s$ is set to $1$.

Note that only the unique values of \texttt{w} are used, so if two or
more elements of \texttt{w} are \emph{identical}, then they refer to
the \emph{same} element in the covariate $x$.

\subsection*{Notes}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{INLA} provide the posterior of $\nu=\beta x$ and NOT
    $x$.  The results comes (default) in the order given by the sorted
    (from low to high) values of \texttt{x} and the field \texttt{ID}
    gives the mapping.
\item The option \verb|scale| defines the scaling in the same order as
    argument \verb|values|.  It is therefore adviced to also give
    argument \verb|values| when \verb|scale| is used to be sure that
    they are consistent.
\end{itemize}

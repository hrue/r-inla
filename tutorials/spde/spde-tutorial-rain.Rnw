A very common data in spatial statistics is the climate data. 
On this section we analyze a data set from Water National 
Agency in Brazil, in Portuguese it is 
\textit{Agencia Nacional de \'Aguas} - ANA. 
The ANA collect data on many locations over Brazil. 
All these data are freely available from the ANA website. 

\section{The data set}

It have data on more one thousand of locations within 
Paran\'a state, a state at south of Brazil. 
We have daily rainfall data on each day of the year 
2011 on 616 locations, including stations within the 
Paran\'a state and around its border. 

We have these dataset on the \pkg{INLA} package 
and call it with 
<<start,results=hide>>=
data(PRprec) 
@ 
We have the coordinates at first two columns, 
altitude at third column  
and more 365 columns, one for each day with the 
daily accumulated precipitation. 

We show bellow some data of four stations: 
the with missing altitude with less latitude, 
the stations with extremes longitudes and
the station with greater altitude. 
<<headdat>>=
PRprec[ii <- c(which(is.na(PRprec$A))[which.min(PRprec$La[is.na(PRprec$A)])], 
               which(PRprec$Lo%in%range(PRprec$Lo)), which.max(PRprec$A)), 1:10]
@ 
We visualize this four stations in red points on the graph at 
right of Figure~\ref{fig:paranastations}. 

We have some problems on this data set. 
For example, we have a spatio-temporal data. 
Also, there are seven stations with missing altitude 
and missing data on daily rainfall. 
The red stations with missing altitude is the red points 
on graph at left of Figure~\ref{fig:paranastations}. 
It's easy to get the altitude only from coordinates information. 
For example, using an digital elevation model, 
google earth or another on line information. 
For example, the station with missing altitude located at south 
and out of border of Paran\'a state is located on a coast city. 
So in this case it is reasonable to assign a small value. 
But, it is possible to build a stochastic model for 
altitude and predict these missing values. 

However, the principal problem is that we have 47 stations 
with missing data and that 10 stations on 45 or more days. 
This problem is treated on next section. 
In this section, we analyze the mean of daily 
accumulated precipitation on January of 2012. 
We compute this covariate with
<<meanjan>>=
PRprec$precMean <- rowMeans(PRprec[,3+1:31], na.rm=TRUE) 
@ 

Also we have the Paran\'a state border 
<<prborder>>=
data(PRborder) 
@ 

We visualize the locations on 
Figure~\ref{fig:paranastations}, 
with the commands bellow
<<precviz,eval=F,results=hide>>=
par(mfrow=c(1,2), mar=c(0,0,2,0)) 
plot(PRborder, type='l', asp=1, axes=FALSE, main='Altitude') 
points(PRprec[1:2], col=is.na(PRprec$Alt)+1, 
       cex=ifelse(is.na(PRprec$Alt), 1, .3+PRprec$Alt/1500))

     main=paste('Mean of daily accumulated precipitation (mm)'))

       bty='n', pch=1, pt.cex=0.3+seq(1,21,5)/20)

\caption{Locations of Paran\'a stations, altitude and average 
  of daily accumulated precipitation (mm) on January.} 
\label{fig:paranastations}
\end{figure}
The size of the points on left graph are 
proportional to altitude of the locations. 
The cyan line in this graph is the Paran\'a 
boundary with the Atlantic Ocean. 
So, we have height altitudes at mid and south, 
low altitudes near the sea and the altitude decrease 
at north and west of Paran\'a state. 
On the right graph, the points sizer are proportional 
to average of daily accumulated precipitation. 
We see that near the coast we have large values. 

\section{The model and covariate selection}

In this section, we analise the average of daily 
accumulated precipitation on that period. 
The average of daily precipitation must be positive. 
So, we consider in this section the model 
\[ \begin{array}{c}
y_i|F_i,\beta,x_i,\theta \sim Gamma(a_i, b_i)\\
log(\mu_i) = F_i^{T}\beta + x_i\\
x_i \sim GF(0, \Sigma) 
\end{array}\]
where, $F_i$ is a vector of covariates (the location 
coordinates and altitude) as covariates, with the vector 
of coefficients $\beta$, 
and a latent Gaussian random field $x$, 
with its covariance matrix function of 
parameters $\nu$, $\kappa$ and $\sigma_x^2$. 
Also, with the Gamma likelihood, we consider that 
$E(y_i) = \mu_i = a_i/b_i$ and 
$V(y_i) = a_i/b_i^2=\mu_i^2/\phi$, 
where $\phi$ us a precision parameter and we 
define a linear predictor to $\text{log}(\mu_i)$. 

To make an initial exploration of relationship between 
the precipitation and the covariates, we visualize some 
dispersion diagrams. 
After preliminary tests, we see that is more adequate the 
construction of a new covariate: 
the distance from each station to Atlantic Ocean. 
We found the coordinates of Paran\'a state border 
that share frontier with the sea (plotted as cyan line on 
left graph at Figure~\ref{fig:paranastations}) and computes 
the distance from each station to the 
neighbor coordinate of this line. 

We compute the distances in Km units 
using the \code{spDists()} function 
from \pkg{sp} package 
<<project>>=
coords <- as.matrix(PRprec[,1:2]) 
mat.dists <- spDists(coords, PRborder[1034:1078,], longlat=TRUE) 
@ 
This function computes the distance between each 
location on the first points set to each one on the 
second points set. So, we need to take the minimum
<<distseacalc>>=
PRprec$"seaDist" <- apply(mat.dists, 1, min) 
@ 
We see the dispersion plots 
at Figure~\ref{fig:disppred}. 
<<dispp,eval=F,results=hide>>=
par(mfrow=c(2,2), mar=c(3,3,0.5,0.5), mgp=c(1.7,.7,0), las=1) 
for (i in c(1:3, ncol(PRprec)))  plot(PRprec[c(i,ncol(PRprec)-1)], cex=.5) 
@ 
\setkeys{Gin}{width=0.9\textwidth}
\begin{figure}\centering
<<dispfig,echo=F,results=hide,fig=T,eps=F,width=7.5,height=5>>=
<<dispp>>

\caption{Dispersion plots of average of daily accumulated 
  precipitation mean by Longitude (top left), Latitude (top right), 
  Altitude (bottom left) and distance to sea (bottom right).} 
\label{fig:disppred}
\end{figure}
With the Figure~\ref{fig:disppred}, we conclude 
that have a not well defined non-linear 
relationship with Longitude, and there is  
a similar, but inverse, relation with sea distance. 
So, we build two models, one with longitude as covariate 
and another with distance to sea as covariate. 
And compute the DIC to decide what model is better. 

To consider a the non-linear relationship, we consider the coefficients 
of these covariates with a semi-parametric trend on 
the relationship, such that the coefficients over the range 
of the covariate values have a first order random walk prior. 
So we have the model adopted is of the form
\[
log(\mu_i) = \alpha + \sum_{j=1}^kw_kI(F_i=F0_k) + x_i \\
\]
were $F$ is the distance to sea or the longitude and $F0_k$ 
is a knot (choose on range of the covariate values) and $w_k$ 
are regression coefficients with first order random walk prior. 

We use the mesh builded for the Paran\'a state on the 
Chapter~\ref{ch:mesh}. 
<<echo=F>>=
load('prmesh2.RData')
@ 

The projector matrix can be done by 
<<projA>>=
A <- inla.spde.make.A(prmesh2, loc=coords)
@ 
The SPDE model is defined by
<<spdem>>=
spde <- inla.spde2.matern(prmesh2, alpha=2)
@ 
and the stack data is defined to include four effects: 
the GRF, intercept, west coordinate and distance to sea
<<stackpr>>=
stk.dat <- inla.stack(data=list(y=PRprec$precMean), 
                      A=list(A,1), tag='dat', 
                      effects=list(list(i=1:spde$n.spde), 
                        data.frame(Intercept=1, 
                                   gWest=inla.group(coords[,1]), 
                                   gSeaDist=inla.group(PRprec$seaDist)))) 
@ 

We fit the two models using the same stack data. 
We just use different formula. For the model 
with west coordinate we have 
<<fitwestcoo>>=
f.west <- y ~ 0 + Intercept + f(gWest, model='rw1') + f(i, model=spde)
r.west <- inla(f.west, family='Gamma', control.compute=list(dic=TRUE),
               data=inla.stack.data(stk.dat), 
               control.predictor=list(A=inla.stack.A(stk.dat), compute=TRUE))
@ 

For the model with distance to sea covariate we have 
<<fitdistsea>>=
f.sead <- y ~ 0 + Intercept + f(gSeaDist, model='rw1') + f(i, model=spde)
r.sead <- inla(f.sead, family='Gamma', control.compute=list(dic=TRUE),
               data=inla.stack.data(stk.dat), 
               control.predictor=list(A=inla.stack.A(stk.dat), compute=TRUE))
@ 

We have the DIC of each model with 
<<dics>>=
c(r.west$dic$dic, r.sead$dic$dic)
@ 
and choose the model that with distance to sea as covariate. 

We got the summary of posterior distribution of the intercept with 
<<betasumary1>>=
r.sead$summary.fixed
@ 

To dispersion parameter of the gamma likelihood we have 
<<disp>>=
r.sead$summary.hy[1,]
@ 

To dispersion parameter of the coefficients of the 
sea distance covariate we have 
<<disp>>=
r.sead$summary.hy[2,]
@ 

And, to $log(\kappa)$ we have 
<<logkappa>>=
r.sead$summary.hy[4,]
@ 

The variance and range of the spatial process 
we need a post processing.  
We obtain the marginal distribution for both by
<<resfield>>=
r.f <- inla.spde2.result(r.sead, 'i', spde, do.transf=TRUE)
@ 
The posterior mean for the marginal variance 
<<mvar>>=
inla.emarginal(function(x) x, r.f$marginals.variance.nominal[[1]])
@ 
And to the practical range of the process we have 
<<range>>=
inla.emarginal(function(x) x, r.f$marginals.range.nominal[[1]])
@ 

At the Figure~\ref{fig:dseaeff} we look the posterior 
distribution to $\beta_0$, $\phi$, 
$1/\kappa$, $\sigma_x^2$, practical range and to the 
mean and 95\% credibility interval of the 
distance to sea effect at Figure~\ref{fig:dseaeff}. 
We choose $1/\kappa$ instead $kappa$ because 
$1/\kappa$ is the range parameter and in 
this case is expressed in degrees units.

\section{Testing the significance of spatial effect}

Now, we want to test the significance of the 
spatial random effect component on the model. 
To access the significance of this effect, 
can be use the DIC measure, comparing the 
model with this component with the DIC of the 
model without this component, fitted below
<<mod0>>=
r0.sead <- inla(y ~ 0 + Intercept + f(gSeaDist, model='rw1'), 
                family='Gamma', control.compute=list(dic=TRUE),
                data=inla.stack.data(stk.dat), 
                control.predictor=list(A=inla.stack.A(stk.dat), compute=TRUE))
@ 
So, we have the DIC of both models with 
<<dics>>=
c(r0.sead$dic$dic, r.sead$dic$dic)
@ 
and conclude that the spatial effect is significantly 
to explain the precipitation. 

\section{Prediction of the random field} 

To show the spatial effect, we make prediction of this 
effect on a fine grid. 
The \code{inla.mesh.projector()} get a projector 
matrix to a regular grid and with equal dimension in 
each direction by default.
The Paran\'a state shape is more width than height. 
So, we choose diferent shape of grid to get an 
adequate cell size. We use 
<<ncoords>>=
(stepsize <- 4*1/111)
(nxy <- round(c(diff(range(PRborder[,1])), diff(range(PRborder[,2])))/stepsize))
@ 
Here we divide the range of each coordinate 
by $4$ kilometers on degree scale. 
We use (4/111) factor because each degree 
has aproximately 111 kilometers. 
Its because we have the coordinates  
with units in kilometers and we want 
each cell on the grid with $4\times 4$ km.

Now, we get the projector with
<<projgrid>>=
projgrid <- inla.mesh.projector(prmesh2, xlim=range(PRborder[,1]), 
                                ylim=range(PRborder[,2]), dims=nxy)
@ 
and get the posterior mean and posterior standard deviation with 
<<projpred>>=
xmean <- inla.mesh.project(projgrid, r.sead$summary.random$i$mean)
xsd <- inla.mesh.project(projgrid, r.sead$summary.random$i$sd)
@ 

To good visualization, we make NA the values corresponding of the 
points of the grid out of the border of the Paran\'a state. 
To do it, we use the function \code{inout()} on \pkg{splancs} 
package, with
<<sp>>=
require(splancs)
table(xy.in <- inout(projgrid$lattice$loc, 
                     cbind(PRborder[,1], PRborder[,2])))
xmean[!xy.in] <- xsd[!xy.in] <- NA
@ 
We visualize the this on Figure~\ref{fig:xrain1}. 
We see on top left graph at Figure~\ref{fig:xrain1} 
that the random field has variation from -0.6 to 0.4. 
It isn't despicable, because we have, on the top 
right graph, the standard errors around 0.2. 
The variation on the mean of this random effect express 
the remain variation after the consideration of the 
effect of the covariate on the model. 
The variation on its standard deviation is due to 
density of stations over the region. 
For example, on the top right graph we see, the first blue 
region from right to left is near Curitiba and 
around there  many stations. 

\section{Prediction of the response on a grid}

We want to predict the response on a grid. 
A naive approach is made by the projection 
of the sum of the linear predictor components 
and applying exponentiation to it, 
because we use the log link. 
A better alternative is the joint 
prediction with the estimation process. 
But it is computationally expensive 
when we have large grid. 

Using the grid from previous section 
we have points discarded because they 
are not within the Paran\'a border. 
To make the predictions only on the points 
within the Paran\'a state we select the 
coordinates of the grid and the correspondent 
rows of the predictor matrix by 
<<>>=
prdcoo <- projgrid$lattice$loc[which(xy.in),]
Aprd <- projgrid$proj$A[which(xy.in), ]
@ 

Now we get the covariate values 
at each point on the grid. 
First we compute the distance to sea
<<seadcov0>>=
seaDist0 <- apply(spDists(PRborder[1034:1078,], prdcoo, longlat=TRUE), 2, min)
@ 
and found the knot group, using the same 
used on the model
<<gsead>>=
ug.seadist <- sort(unique(inla.group(PRprec$seaDist)))
ig0 <- apply(abs(outer(ug.seadist, seaDist0, '-')),2,which.min)
g.seadist <- ug.seadist[ig0]
@ 
and put it into on a stack to prediction and 
join with the stack data 
<<stkprd>>=
stk.prd <- inla.stack(data=list(y=NA), A=list(Aprd,1), 
                      effects=list(i=1:spde$n.spde, 
                          data.frame(Intercept=1, 
                                     gSeaDist=g.seadist)), tag='prd') 
stk.all <- inla.stack(stk.dat, stk.prd)
@ 

Now, we fit the model joining the prediction data 
together the observed data stack. 
But, now we don't need the computation of DIC, 
marginal distributions and quantiles, just 
the mean and standard deviation of the response 
<<predfit>>=
r2.sead <- inla(f.sead, family='Gamma', data=inla.stack.data(stk.all), 
                control.predictor=list(A=inla.stack.A(stk.all), 
                  compute=TRUE), quantiles=NULL, 
                control.results=list(return.marginals.random=FALSE,
                  return.marginals.predictor=FALSE))
@ 

Now, we extract the index on the predictor that 
corresponds to these wanted. 
Also, we put the mean and standard deviation 
on the matrix format, in the adequate positions.
<<rprevprep>>=
id.prd <- inla.stack.index(stk.all, 'prd')$data
sd.prd <- m.prd <- matrix(NA, nxy[1], nxy[2])
m.prd[xy.in] <- r2.sead$summary.fitted.values$mean[id.prd]
sd.prd[xy.in] <- r2.sead$summary.fitted.values$sd[id.prd]
@ 
and we visualize on the Figure~\ref{fig:xrain1} 
the posterior mean and standard deviation to 
response with commands bellow  
<<xrain1c,eval=F>>=
library(gridExtra) 
do.call('grid.arrange', 
        lapply(list(xmean, xsd, m.prd, sd.prd), 
               levelplot, col.regions=terrain.colors(16), 
               xlab='', ylab='', scales=list(draw=FALSE)))

\end{figure}
We see at this Figure a clear pattern 
on the average of the daily accumulated 
precipitation occurred on January of 2012. 
It's high near to sea and lower 
at north west side of the Paran\'a state.

@ 

Because the SPDE model is defined on the 
mesh, we need an appropriate specification 
of the linear predictor for the data response. 
For details on this please see~\cite{lindgren:2012}. 

The key is that we have a random field 
modeled at the mesh vertices, with dimention $m$, 
and a response at $n$ locations. 
So, we need to define how the random field and 
other model components are linked to the response. 

Let the matrix $\bA$ that links the 
process on the mesh vertices triangles 
with the locations response. 
This matrix is called the projector matrix 
because it do the projection of the 
latent field modeled at mesh vertices 
to data locations. 

The projector matrix can be builded with 
the \code{inla.spde.make.A} function. 
Considering that each mesh vertices has a weight, 
the value for one point within one triangle is 
the projection of the plane (formed by these 
three weights) at this point location. 
This projection is just a weighted average 
with the weights computed by the 
\code{inla.spde.make.A()} function. 
Using the toy data set and the mesh five we have
<<proj2>>=
coords <- as.matrix(SPDEtoy[,1:2])
A5 <- inla.spde.make.A(mesh5, loc=coords)
@ 

This matrix has dimention equal the number of 
data locations by the number of vertices on 
the mesh 
<<dima1>>=
dim(A5)
@ 
We have exact three non-zero elemens on each line 
<<a5lines>>=
table(rowSums(A5>0))
@ 
because each location points are 
inside one of the triangles. 
These three non-zero elements 
on each line sums one
<<rsum>>=
table(rowSums(A5))
@ 
because multiplication with any vector weights 
at mesh nodes by this matrix is the projection 
of these weights at the location points. 

We have some columns on the projector 
matrix with all elements equals zero. 
<<colsA>>=
table(colSums(A5)>0)
@ 
This columns corresponds the triangles 
without any location point inside.
This columns that can be droped and 
the stack functionality (section~\ref{sec:stack}) 
automatically handles this situation.

When we have a mesh where each location 
points are on the vertice set, the projector 
matrix has exact one line with nonzero element
<<eacha1>>=
A1 <- inla.spde.make.A(mesh1, loc=coords)
table(rowSums(A1>0))
@
and all these elements are equals one 
<<summarya1>>=
table(rowSums(A1))
@ 
because in this case the the projection on the 
location points are just the weight at the 
corresponding node (at same location) of the mesh. 

\section{GRF sampling through SPDE}\label{sec:simula} 

The main thing is that the SPDE make the model 
on the mesh vertices and we need to make simulation 
on a set o location points. 
We start by defining the spde model 
<<spde>>=
spde5 <- inla.spde2.matern(mesh5, alpha=2)
@ 
and build the precision matrix associated. 

It can be done by the \code{inla.spde2.precision()} function. 
On this function, we have to provide the SPDE model 
and the parameters $\theta$ on the SPDE parametrization. 
$\theta$ is a length two vector where the second element 
is the logarithim of the scale parameter, log($\kappa$), 
and the first one is the 'local variance parameter' $\tau$
such that the marginal variance $\sigma_x^2$ is 
\[ \sigma_x^2 = \frac{1}{4\pi\tau^2\kappa^2} \] 
and we have that 
\[\log(\tau) = \theta_1 = -\log(4\pi\kappa^2\sigma_x^2)/2 \;.\] 

We do the simulation considering $\kappa=5$ and $\sigma_x^2=1$ 
<<params>>=
kappa <- 5;    s2x <- 1
@ 
so, we have 
<<theta>>=
theta <- c(-log(4*pi*s2x*kappa^2), log(kappa))
@ 
and we have the precision matrix $\bQ(\theta)$ by 
<<q5>>=
Q5 <- inla.spde2.precision(spde5, theta)
@ 

Now, we can use the \code{inla.qsample()} function 
to get a sample at mesh nodes by 
<<x5>>=
x5 <- inla.qsample(Q=Q5)
@ 
and to get a sample at the locations, we just 
project it with the projector matrix by 
<<x>>=
x <- drop(A5%*%x5)
@ 

We can have a more general function to generate 
one or more samples, by defining a function that 
need just the coordinates and model parameters. 
A mesh can be provided and if not it is also 
generated within this function 
<<rspde>>=
rspde
@ 

We can generate samples at a milion of locations 
in some seconds  
<<sample>>=
pts1 <- matrix(runif(2e6), ncol=2)
x1 <- rspde(pts1, kappa=5)
@ 

Some summary
<<summx1>>=
summary(x1)
table(x1>0)
@ 
and we have the attributes together 
<<attribs>>=
names(attributes(x1))
attr(x1, 'cpu') ### time in seconds
attr(x1, 'mesh')$n ### number of mesh nodes 
dim(attr(x1, 'Q')) 
dim(attr(x1, 'A'))
@ 

This function is used on some of next Chapters.

\section{Maximum likelihood inference}

We have that the latent random field $x$ 
is distributed as 
\[ x|\bQ \sim N(0, \bQ^{-1})\;\]
where $\bQ = \bQ(\theta)$, 
$\theta=\{\theta_1, \theta_2\}$ with 

$\theta_1$=log($\tau$) and $\theta_2$=log($\kappa$). 
Under the toy model, whe have an GF plus noise 
for the observation data. So, we have 
\[y|\mu_y,x,\bA,\bQ,\sigma_y^2 \sim N(\mu_y + \bA x, \bI \sigma^2_y)\;.\]
Integrating out $x$, we have that 
\[ y | \mu_y, \bQ, \bA, \sigma_y^2 \sim 
N(\mu_y, (\bA \bQ^{-1}\bA' + \bI\sigma_y^2)^{-1}) \;.\]

The log-likelihood function, 
marginalized with respect $x$, becomes 
\[
-\frac{n}{2}\log(2\pi)-|\Sigma|-
\frac{1}{2}(y-\bF\beta)^{'}\Sigma^{-1}(y-\bF\beta) 
\]
where 
$\Sigma = (\bA \bQ^{-1}\bA' + \bI\sigma_y^2)^{-1}$ 
and $\bQ=\bQ(\theta) = \bQ(\tau,\kappa)$. 
We choose $\tau^{'}$ to have marginal variance of $x$ equal 1, 
$\bQ(\tau^{'}, \kappa))$ = $\bQ^{'}$. 
In this case we write 
$\bW = (r\bI + Q(\tau^{'}, \kappa))$ 
where $r=\frac{\sigma^2_e}{\sigma^2_x}$ and 
\[
\Sigma = \sigma^2_x\bW\;.
\] 

Now, we can write a concentrated likelihood deriving 
the likelihood with respect to $\sigma^2_x$ and $\beta$. 
We have that 
\[ (\bF^{'}\bW\bF)\hat{\beta} = \bF^{'}\bW\bby \;.\] 
and  
\[
\hat{\sigma}^2_x = (y_i-\bF\hat{\beta})^{'}\bW(y_i-\bF\hat{\beta})/n
\] 

Now, we can work with the log-likelihood 
as a function of the noise relative variance and 
the scale parameter $\kappa$. 
The concentrated log-likelihood can be writed as 
\[
-\frac{1}{2}\{|\bW| + n[\log(2\pi\hat{\sigma}^2_x)+1]\}
\]
And we can use one of the quasi-Newton 
optimization algorithim to find the maximum 
likelihood estimate of each the two parameters 
on the concentrated likelihood. 
These parameters are these one the $\bW$ matrix and 
are parametrized as log($r$) and log($\kappa$). 

To eval the likelihood function efficiently 
we need to take care on the evaluation of 
the determinant $|\bW|$ and of $\bW$ itself. 

$\bW = (r\bI + Q(\tau^{'}, \kappa))$ 

To evaluate the determinant, we use a 
matrix determinant lemma such that we have 
\[\det(r\bI + \bA \bQ \bA^{'}) = 
  \det(\bQ + \bA^{'}r\bA) \det(\bQ) \det(r\bI)\;.
  \]
We implement the following function to compute it 
<<precdetf,echo=F>>=
precDetFun
@ 

The precision matrix can be evaluated 
using the Woodbury matrix identity. 
It says that for $\bC$ and $\bW$ invertible 
matrices we have  
\[(r\bI + \bA \bQ \bA^{'})^{-1} = 
 r^{-1}\bI - r^{-1}\bI\bA(\bQ + 
  \bA r^{-1}\bA)^{-1}\bA r^{-1}\;.\]
We implement it with the following function
<<precf,echo=F>>=
precFun
@ 

Considering $\theta$ and log($\sigma_y^2$) the 
three parameter vetor, we have the following 
negative of the log likelihood function 
<<nllf,echo=F>>=
negLogLikFun
@ 

We proceed the maximum likelihood estimation, 
for the toy example dataset and compare with 
the results from \pkg{geoR} package of previous Chapter. 
We remember also the true parameter values
<<true>>=
beta0 <- 10; sigma2e <- 0.3; sigma2x <- 5; kappa <- 7; nu <- 1
@ 

We call the data
<<spdetoydata>>=
data(SPDEtoy)
@ 
build the mesh (using the true scale parameter to 
determine the edge lengths and \code{cutoff}), 
SPDE model (with $\alpha=2$) 
and the projector matrix
<<dprep>>=
xy <- as.matrix(SPDEtoy[,1:2])
(mesh <- inla.mesh.2d(xy, max.edge=c(0.5, 1)/kappa, 
                      cutoff=0.1/kappa))$n 
spde <- inla.spde2.matern(mesh)
A <- inla.mesh.project(mesh, loc=xy)$A
@

The maximum likelihood estimation is done 
using the \code{optim()} function. 
Using the default Nelder-Mead method
<<nm>>= 
opt <- optim(log(c(sigma2e/sigma2x, kappa)), negLogLikFun, hessian=TRUE,
             X=matrix(1,nrow(xy)), A=A, y=SPDEtoy[,3], spde=spde) 
@ 

We also define a function to map the 
SPDE model parameters to the 
$\sigma_x^2$ and $\kappa$ user parameters. 
The function bellow recieve $\theta$, 
log($\sigma_y^2$) and $\beta$ (regression 
parameters) and return $\sigma_x^2$, $\kappa$, 
$\sigma_y^2$ and $\beta$. 
<<par2user,echo=F>>=
par2user
@ 

We use this function to compare the results with 
the results by \code{geoR} package 
<<lkfgeoR>>=
require(geoR)
system.time(lkf <- likfit(as.geodata(SPDEtoy),
                          ini=c(sigma2x, 1/kappa), 
                          kappa=1, ### kappa in geoR is nu 
                          nugget=sigma2e))
@ 
and have similar results 
<<compare>>=
rbind(spde=par2user(opt$par, matrix(1, nrow(A)), A, SPDEtoy[,3], spde),
      geoR=c(lkf$beta, lkf$nugget, lkf$sigmasq, 1/lkf$phi), 
      true=c(beta0, sigma2e, sigma2x, kappa))

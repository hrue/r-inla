\chapter{Starting example}

Provide an example that illustrates the most central point of R-INLA
and also points common to several examples. Thus, maybe an
interesting/popular example including fixed and random effects.

Show data structure, model definition, inla call, output + interpretation.

Goal: After reading this section the reader should already have
an idea about how \verb|R-INLA| works, its structure, output and some details.

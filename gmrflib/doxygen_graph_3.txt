Reading a graph from the file 'graph1.dat':

graph has 10 nodes
node 0 has 4 neighbors: 0 1 2 5
node 1 has 3 neighbors: 0 2 3
node 2 has 5 neighbors: 0 1 3 4 5
node 3 has 3 neighbors: 0 1 2
node 4 has 3 neighbors: 2 5 7
node 5 has 5 neighbors: 0 2 4 6 7
node 6 has 2 neighbors: 5 7
node 7 has 4 neighbors: 4 5 6 8
node 8 has 2 neighbors: 7 9
node 9 has 1 neighbors: 8

Computing subgraph:

graph has 5 nodes
node 0 has 2 neighbors: 1 2
node 1 has 2 neighbors: 0 2
node 2 has 3 neighbors: 0 1 3
node 3 has 2 neighbors: 2 4
node 4 has 1 neighbors: 3
node 0 corresponds to mother-node 5
node 1 corresponds to mother-node 6
node 2 corresponds to mother-node 7
node 3 corresponds to mother-node 8
node 4 corresponds to mother-node 9

Creating a lattice graph:

graph has 42 nodes
node 0 has 3 neighbors: 1 7 8
node 1 has 5 neighbors: 0 2 7 8 9
node 2 has 5 neighbors: 1 3 8 9 10
node 3 has 5 neighbors: 2 4 9 10 11
node 4 has 5 neighbors: 3 5 10 11 12
node 5 has 5 neighbors: 4 6 11 12 13
node 6 has 3 neighbors: 5 12 13
node 7 has 5 neighbors: 0 1 8 14 15
node 8 has 8 neighbors: 0 1 2 7 9 14 15 16
node 9 has 8 neighbors: 1 2 3 8 10 15 16 17

Extracting node indices:

Lattice indices (0,0) correspond to node no. 0
Lattice indices (0,1) correspond to node no. 1
Lattice indices (0,2) correspond to node no. 2
Lattice indices (0,3) correspond to node no. 3
Lattice indices (0,4) correspond to node no. 4
Lattice indices (0,5) correspond to node no. 5
Lattice indices (0,6) correspond to node no. 6
Lattice indices (1,0) correspond to node no. 7
Lattice indices (1,1) correspond to node no. 8

# Introduction

In this tutorial, we illustrate the implementation of the barrier
model proposed in Bakka et al. (2019) in the sphere. It considers the
problem of modeling over a spatial domain, taking into account
physical barriers and the spherical shape of the Earth. Since we are
working on the global oceans, continents can be considered as physical
barriers, and this aspect has to be taken into account in the
modeling. When using a barrier model, the range is not only determined
by the distance to points. If there is a barrier between two points,
the range should decrease quickly, and the correlation over the
barrier should approach zero. Additionally, the Earth's spherical
shape is a crucial factor in this particular case, as considering a
planar approximation can bias the results when working on a global
scale. Therefore, this tutorial is developed using a projection onto a
sphere. We are using the new implementation of the INLA package.

```{r}
# Load required libraries
library(rnaturalearth)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(INLA)
library(INLAspacetime)
library(inlabru)
library(ggOceanMaps)
library(tidyverse)
library(s2)
library(DOYPAColors)
library(ggpubr)
```

# Define barriers

Our initial step is to define the barriers in the model. As we aim to
model an oceanic variable, it is essential to treat all continents as
barriers. To accomplish this, we must establish specific parameters,
including the mesh resolution, maximum edge length of the mesh, and
define a distance and a buffer to simplify certain country polygons.
If we increase the mesh resolution, the computational time will also
increase.

```{r}
# Mesh resolution (bigger number increases the resolution)
sresol <- 30 

# This resolution will gives the approximate maximum edge length (in km) 
max_edge <- 36080.2 * 0.2 / sresol
units(max_edge) <- "km"

# Set a minimum distance to be used for simplification of polygons
dist_simplify <- 20
units(dist_simplify) <- "km"

# Set a buffer distance to be added to certain polygons 
bufferdist <- max_edge / 2
```

Subsequently, we use the **ne_countries** function from the
rnaturalearth package to download data for all countries, employing
the Mollweide projection. We specify that we want an object class of
Simple Features (sf) for ease in conducting spatial operations.

```{r}
# Download country boundaries data at a medium scale
world_ll <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")

# Retrieve the coordinate reference system (CRS) of the downloaded data
crs_ll <- st_crs(world_ll)

# Define Mollweide projection 
crs_vis <- st_crs("+proj=moll +units=km +units=km")

# Transform the country boundaries data to the Mollweide projection
world_mll <- st_transform(st_geometry(world_ll), crs_vis)
```

We now create a function to define a bounding box around the earth 
in the latlong projection. This will be used later.
```{r EarthPoly_fn}
# function to create a Earth polygon
Earth_poly <- function(resol = 100) {
    st_sfc(st_multipolygon(
        list(st_polygon(list(cbind(
            long = c(
                seq(-1, 1, length.out = resol * 2 + 1), rep(1, resol + 1),
                seq(1, -1, length.out = resol * 2 + 1), rep(-1, resol + 1)
            ) * (180 - 1e-5),
            lat = c(
                rep(1, resol * 2 + 1), seq(1, -1, length.out = resol + 1),
                rep(-1, resol * 2 + 1), seq(-1, 1, length.out = resol + 1)
            ) * (90 - 1e-5)
        ))))), crs = "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0")
}
```

We also need to prepare a grid for projecting the effects of the
model, considering the Mollweide projection and the spherical shape of
the Earth. To accomplish this, we have implemented a function called
**barrier_mgrid**. This function creates a grid of points within a
specified boundary that do not intersect with a given barrier. The
barrier can be either a Simple Features (sf) or Simple Features
Collection (sfc) object representing a geographic region, and the
boundary can be specified by either providing a boundary object or
numeric limits for x and y axes.

```{r grid_fn}
# Function to create the grid for projection while considering the barrier
grid_create <- function(barrier, resol = 50) {
  if (!inherits(barrier, c("sf", "sfc"))) {
    stop("barrier must be sf or sfc objects.")
  }
  Ell <- Earth_poly(resol = 100)
  if (st_crs(Ell) != st_crs(barrier)) {
    Ell_transformed <- st_transform(Ell, st_crs(barrier))
  } else {
    Ell_transformed <- Ell
  }
  grid_0 <- st_as_sf(
    expand.grid(x = seq(from = min(st_coordinates(Ell_transformed)[,1]), 
                        to = max(st_coordinates(Ell_transformed)[,1]), 
                        by = resol),
                y = seq(from = min(st_coordinates(Ell_transformed)[,2]), 
                        to = max(st_coordinates(Ell_transformed)[,2]), 
                        by = resol)),
    coords = 1:2, crs = st_crs(barrier))
  ig_0 <- which(sapply(st_intersects(grid_0, Ell_transformed), length) > 0)
  ig_sel <- setdiff(ig_0,
                   which(sapply(st_intersects(grid_0, barrier), length) > 0)
  )
  grid_mll <- grid_0[ig_sel, ]
  return(grid_mll)
}

# Grid in Mollweide 
mgrid <- barrier_mgrid(barrier = world_mll)

# Grid in latlong 
grid_ll <- st_transform(mgrid, crs = crs_ll)

# Transform to the sphere 
mgrid_sph <- fm_transform(
    mgrid,
    crs = fm_crs("sphere")
)
```

At this point, we will modify some of the barrier polygons to enhance
realism and facilitate computation. First, we will calculate the area
of each polygon downloaded earlier and if they are isolated or not.
This is to identify small and isolated islands that may not be
relevant to our model, and we should exclude them from the barrier.

```{r}
# Compute the area of each polygon
world_area <- st_area(world_mll)

# Extract the neighbor list from this map (consider neighbor if any coordinate within the buffer distance)
nb <- spdep:::poly2nb(
                pl = world_mll,
                snap = as.numeric(bufferdist))

# Number of neighbors
nn <- spdep::card(nb)

# Identify small multipolygons (area smaller than square of the approximated maximum length of the edges in the modeling domain)
wpolyclass <- paste(ifelse(sqrt(world_area) > max_edge, "big", "small"),
                    ifelse(nn>0, "connected", "isolated"))
```

Moreover, we will give the option for expanding some straits, such as
the Suez Canal or the Strait of Gibraltar to minimize correlation near
the borders.

```{r}
# Enlarge Suez canal
# Define the coordinates for the Suez canal polygon
suez_ll <- matrix(
    c(31.6, 31.7, 43.9, 43.8, 31.6,
      31.5, 31.7, 12.0, 11.8, 31.5),
    ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE)

# Create a Simple Features (sf) polygon for the Suez canal
suez_ll <- sf::st_sfc(
    sf::st_polygon(
        list(suez_ll)
    ), crs = crs_ll
)

# Transform the Suez canal polygon and create a buffer
suez_mll <- st_buffer(
    st_transform(suez_ll, crs_vis),
    dist = bufferdist
)

# Enlarge strait of Gibraltar 
# Define the coordinates for the Strait of Gibraltar polygon
gibra_ll <- matrix(
    c(-6.0, -5.2, -5.2, -6.0, -6.0,
      36.0, 36.0, 35.9, 35.9, 36.0), 
    ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE)

# Create a Simple Features (sf) polygon for the Strait of Gibraltar
gibra_ll <- sf::st_sfc(
    sf::st_polygon(
        list(gibra_ll)
    ), crs = crs_ll
)

# Transform the Strait of Gibraltar polygon and create a buffer
gibra_mll <- st_buffer(
    st_transform(gibra_ll, crs_vis),
    dist = bufferdist
)

# Enlarge Turkish straits 
# Define the coordinates for the Turkish straits polygon
turk_ll <- matrix(
  c(26.1, 39.95,
    29.35, 41.15,
    29.3, 41.35,
    26.05, 40.15,
    26.1, 39.95),  
  ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE
)

# Create a Simple Features (sf) polygon for the  Turkish straits
turk_ll <- sf::st_sfc(
    sf::st_polygon(
        list(turk_ll)
    ), crs = crs_ll
)

# Transform the Turkish straits polygon and create a buffer
turk_mll <- st_buffer(
    st_transform(turk_ll, crs_vis),
    dist = bufferdist/6
)
```

After identifying the area and isolation of the polygons, we will
remove those polygons from the barrier that are considered isolated
and small.

```{r}
# Remove small and isolated polygons
world_barrier_initial <- st_difference(
    world_mll[wpolyclass != "small isolated"],
    st_union(c(suez_mll, gibra_mll, turk_mll))
    )
```

Likewise, we plan to incorporate buffers around specific regions of
the world. For example, we want to account for the closure of the
Panama Canal, consider the ice cover of Antarctica, and include a
buffer around the Gulf of Ob to facilitate the simulation.

```{r}
# Panama country polygon retrieval and buffer creation
panm_ll <- ne_countries(country = "panama", scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")
panm_mll <- st_buffer(
    st_transform(st_geometry(panm_ll), crs_vis),
    dist = bufferdist)

# Define the coordinates for the Gulf of Ob polygon
gulf_ll <- matrix(
  c(70, 78, 78, 70, 70,
    65, 65, 73, 73, 65), 
  ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE)

# Create a Simple Features (sf) polygon for the Gulf of Ob
gulf_ll <- sf::st_sfc(
  sf::st_polygon(
    list(gulf_ll)
  ), crs = crs_ll
)

# Transform the Gulf of Ob polygon and create a buffer 
gulf_mll <- st_buffer(
  st_transform(gulf_ll, crs_vis),
  dist = bufferdist)

# Download Antarctica polygon
antar_ll <- ne_countries(country = "Antarctica", scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")

# Include a buffer 
antar_mll <- st_buffer(
  st_transform(st_geometry(antar_ll), crs_vis),
  dist = bufferdist)
```

Once the specific polygons have been modified, we can proceed to
integrate them with our multipolygon of world countries. We also use
the *st_simplify* function to simplify the borders of the polygons
while preserving the topology of the domain.

```{r}
# Buffer world land
world_lnd <- st_union(c(world_barrier_initial, panm_mll, gulf_mll, antar_mll))

# World land excluding the Suez canal, Turkish straits, and Gibraltar strait 
world_dff <- st_difference(
    x = world_lnd,
    y = st_union(c(suez_mll, gibra_mll, turk_mll))
)

# World land without modifications for visualization
world_union <- st_union(world_mll)

# Join and simplify the boundary of the barrier domain so that very detailed parts would be smoothed out
world_barrier <- st_simplify(
    world_dff, 
    preserveTopology = FALSE,
    dTolerance = dist_simplify)
```

# Mesh Creation

The barrier model proposed by Bakka et al. (2019), involves a
triangulation method. Therefore, we are going to consider an
underlying random field over the whole sphere; and this random field
will be discretized using the mesh, defining a precision matrix for
the distribution at the mesh nodes. In order to work more efficiently,
we will simulate higher-resolution points outside the barrier using
the **fmesher_globe_points** function. This allows us to utilize these
initial points to reduce the number of nodes inside the barrier.
Consequently, this will improve computation speed without compromising
the results of the model. It's crucial to note that the mesh is
designed with consideration for a sphere (**fm_transform**), allowing
us to work in three dimensions.

```{r}
# Create a initial set of points over the globe considering the desired resolution
reg.glob.pts <- fmesher_globe_points(
    globe = sresol # subdivision resolution for a semi-regular spherical triangulation with equidistant points along equidistant latitude bands
)

# Project it to the working projection (sphere)
inipts0 <- fm_transform(
    st_as_sf(as.data.frame(reg.glob.pts),
             coords = 1:3,
             crs = fm_crs("sphere")),
    fm_crs(world_barrier))

# Verify which of these points are inside an extended model domain
in_ocean <- which(sapply(st_intersects(
    inipts0,
    st_buffer(st_union(world_lnd), dist = - bufferdist/2)
), length)==0)
```

After the definition of the points and the projection, we can generate
the mesh and examine the number of nodes it contains. For this
particular scenario, the mesh comprises a total of 7068 nodes. To
achieve this, we utilize the **fm_rcdt_2d function**, specifying the
*globe* argument with the desired resolution, the *crs* for the
sphere, *loc* for the high-resolution points previously created, and
the *cutoff* to avoid tiny triangles.

```{r}
# Create a triangular mesh on the globe with a specified resolution
smesh <- fm_rcdt_2d_inla(
    loc = reg.glob.pts[in_ocean, ], # use the initial points
    globe = 10, # we use lower resolution for the rest (barrier) of the domain
    cutoff = 1 / sresol, # to avoid tiny triangles
    crs = fm_crs("sphere") # the 'CRS' for the mesh over the sphere
)

# Number of nodes
smesh$n 
```

Now, we can perform operations on that mesh using different map
projections. We are interested in utilizing the Mollweide projection
for plotting the mesh. To achieve this, we employ the **fm_transform**
function.

```{r}
# Collect the mesh locations and directly transform it to the Mollweide projection
lmesh_mll <- fm_transform(
    st_as_sf(as.data.frame(smesh$loc), coords = 1:3,
             crs = fm_crs(smesh)), 
    crs = crs_vis)
```

Since we are working with a barrier model, we need to identify the
mesh nodes that are inside the barriers. For that, we will use the
function **fm_contains**, which finds triangle centroids or vertices
inside sf or sp polygon objects.

```{r}
# Extract triangles containing barriers
triBarrier <- unlist(fm_contains(
  x = world_barrier, # Barrier polygons
  y = smesh, # Mesh 
  type = "centroid" 
)) 
```

# Divide by the square root of triCenters.xyz  (the barrier triangles setup will be moved to the barrier model code, so the user will not have to deal with this)
triCenters.xyz <- triCenters.xyz0 / sqrt(rowSums(triCenters.xyz0^2))

# Convert the triangle centers coordinates to the Mollweide projection
allTri.mll <- fm_transform(
    x = st_as_sf(x = as.data.frame(triCenters.xyz),
                 coords = 1:3, crs = fm_crs(smesh)),

# Correlation values at specific points

We can utilize the discretized model to calculate correlations between
pairs of points to assess the model properties before simulation.
Initially, it is essential to define the key parameters of the barrier
model, aligning with an SPDE model: the practical range and the
marginal variance (Lindgren et al. 2011). The barrier's range is
determined as a fraction of the range across the entire domain.
Specifically, we set a range of 0.63, corresponding to 4000 km. In
proximity to a barrier, we use 0.008 of the value of the range.

```{r}
# Create a barrier model using the mesh 
bfem <- mesh2fem.barrier(smesh, triBarrier)

# Set parameters for barrier field simulation
sigma <- 1 # standard deviation 
ranges <- c(4000, 50) / (s2::s2_earth_radius_meters()/1e3) # practical range: 4000km

# Create a precision matrix with the specified parameters
Q <- inla.barrier.q(bfem, ranges = ranges, sigma = sigma)
```

Then, we need to use the already defined function *localCorrel2D* in
the tutorial "A Barrier Model Illustration"
(https://github.com/eliaskrainski/INLAspacetime), to compute the
correlation from a given set of locations to each mesh node location
(with minor changes in the function).

```{r}
# Define a function for calculating local correlations
localCorrel2D <- function(locs, mesh.locs, Q) {
    nl <- nrow(locs)  # Number of locations

    ii <- sapply(1:nl, function(i)
        which.min(s2_distance(
            mesh.locs, locs[i,],
            radius = s2_earth_radius_meters()))
        )  # Indices of the closest locations on the mesh

    
    b <- matrix(0, nrow(Q), nl)  # Initialize a matrix of zeros
    for (i in 1:nl)
        b[ii[i], i] <- 1  # Set 1 at positions corresponding to the closest locations
    
    cc <- inla.qsolve(Q, b)  # Solve the linear system Q * cc = b
    s <- sqrt(diag(inla.qinv(Q)))  # Calculate the square root of the diagonal of the inverse of Q
    for (i in 1:nl)
        cc[, i] <- cc[, i] / (s * s[ii[i]])  # Normalize local correlations
    return(drop(cc))  # Return normalized local correlations
}
```

We start by selecting various locations and transform them into
Mollweide coordinates. We have chosen locations that are close to
barriers or between barriers, so it's easy to verify if the model is
working properly. We should observe a decrease around the barrier. We
will also convert the mesh into latitude and longitude coordinates,
allowing us to work with a 2D representation of the mesh.

```{r}
# Locations for correlation calculation
locs_ll <- matrix(c(

                  projection = "longlat", # the projection type

    )

)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(locs_ll, caption = "Locations for computing correlations.", col.names = c("x coordinates", "y coordinates"))
```

Then, we use the function previously defined, **localCorrel2D**, to
compute the correlation. Since our function works in a 2D dimension we
need to use the mesh into the latitude and longitude projection
(*mesh_locs_ll*) previously define, so we can work the correlation on
the planar.

```{r}
# Calculate local correlations
mcorrels <- localCorrel2D(
    locs_latlong, # locations
    mesh_locs_ll, # mesh projected
    Q # precision matrix
)
```

The correlation can be projected and visualized "everywhere". However,
it is essential to transform the grid coordinates onto the sphere
initially, considering the mesh has been projected in three
dimensions. Once we have the *gproj* in spherical coordinates, we can
further transform them into kilometer coordinates using the Mollweide
projection for visualization.

```{r}
# Create a grid projector using the mesh and spherical grid
gproj <- inla.mesh.projector(mesh = smesh, loc = mgrid_sph)

# Project local correlations to the grid
gcorrels <- -1 + 2 * plogis(as.matrix(inla.mesh.project(
  gproj, field = qlogis(0.5 + (0.5 -1e-9) * mcorrels)
)))

# Create a data frame for correlation visualization
mgrid_cor <- st_coordinates(mgrid)
  
# Combine data for ggplot
ggcorrels <- do.call(
  rbind, 
  lapply(1:nrow(locs_ll), function(l) 
      data.frame(
          mgrid_cor, 
          loc = paste0(
              "l", l, ": (",
              sprintf("%1.1f", locs_ll[l, 1]), ", ",
              sprintf("%1.1f", locs_ll[l, 2]), ")"), 
          correlation = gcorrels[, l])))

# Simulation of the space-time barrier model 

Having established the parameters (range and standard deviation) in
the previous section and verified their properties, we can proceed to
compute the simulated random field for the barrier model.
Subsequently, we can project the random field onto the defined grid
for visualization. Since we are working in space and time, we have
simulated a total of 6 random fields.

```{r}
# Number of years k 
k <- 6

# Initialize lists to store random seeds and spatial fields
seed <- c(1,345,123,663,2314,654)
u <- list()

# Generate random samples for each spatial field
for(i in 1:k) {
  u[[i]] <- inla.qsample(1, Q, seed = seed[[i]])
}

# Project the field grid onto the Mollweide projection
grid_sf <- list()
for(i in 1:k) {
  grid_sf[[i]] <- st_as_sf(data.frame(
    st_coordinates(mgrid),
    u_proj = inla.mesh.project(gproj, as.vector(u[[i]]))),
    coords = 1:2, crs = crs_vis)
}
```

Then, to ensure they are not independent from each other, we are going
to correlate them using an autoregressive model of order 1 (AR1).

```{r}
# Autoregressive smoothing
rho <- 0.98
u_time <- u
for(i in 2:k) {
  u_time[[i]] <- rho * u_time[[i-1]] + sqrt(1-rho^2) * u_time[[i]]
}

# Project the field grid onto the Mollweide projection
grid_sf_u <- list()
for(i in 1:k) {
  grid_sf_u[[i]] <- st_as_sf(data.frame(
    st_coordinates(mgrid),

# Simulation of locations

Regarding the simulation of the response variable, we first need to
determine a set of locations where our variable will be observed. To
achieve this, we simulate *n* values from a polygon within the limits
of our domain, and the observations will vary for each time. Note that
the simulation of locations takes into account a coordinate reference
system (CRS). Without a CRS, there would be a disproportionately large
number of points near the poles compared to the equator. This
discrepancy arises due to the Earth's shape, and utilizing a CRS helps
maintain a more balanced and accurate representation in our
simulations.

```{r, results='hide'}
# Generate random data locations in longlat
# Create world-size sampling area without crs
world_poly_wgs84 <- Earth_poly(resol = 100)

# Add WGS84 crs to a duplicated object
st_crs(world_poly_wgs84) <- 4326

# convert to the Mollweid projection
world_poly_planar <- st_transform(
  x = world_poly_wgs84, 
  crs = crs_vis
)

# Sample the locations for each time
set.seed(34521)
# Number of observations
n <- 3500 
sf::sf_use_s2(FALSE)
locs_mll <- list()
# Random sampling
seed_2 <- c(34521, 323,43454,24213,2311,2344)
for(i in 1:k) {
  set.seed(seed_2[[i]])
  locs_mll[[i]] <- sf::st_sample(world_poly_planar, n, type = "random", exact = TRUE)
}

# Transform data locations to the longlat projection
locs_ll <- list()
for(i in 1:k) {
  locs_ll[[i]] <- st_transform(locs_mll[[i]], crs = st_crs(world_poly_wgs84))
}
```

Point out that we need to exclude all points that are inside a
barrier, as our response variable cannot be observed inside.

```{r}
# Identify locations outside the world polygon in Mollweide projection
ilocs_in <- list()
locs <- list()
for(i in 1:k) {
  ilocs_in[[i]] <- which(sapply(st_intersects(
    locs_mll[[i]], world_barrier), length) == 0)
  ## extract the coordinates
  locs[[i]] <- st_coordinates(locs_ll[[i]])[ilocs_in[[i]], ]
}
```

Furthermore, we transform the points onto the sphere using the
**fm_transform** function, allowing us to fit the model later on in
3D.

```{r}
# Map the data locations back to the sphere
locs_sph <- list()
for(i in 1:k) {
  locs_sph[[i]] <- fm_transform(
    x = locs_mll[[i]][ilocs_in[[i]]],
    crs = fm_crs("sphere"))

# Covariate: depth

Here, we aim to include a continuous covariate with a linear effect.
For that, we are going to use the ocean depth and consider a negative
linear effect. Note that to download the depth data, you need to run
this in R outside of Quarto or Rmarkdown. You only need to do this
once.

```{r, results='hide'}
# Download of depth/bathymetry 
depth_values <- list()
for(i in 1:k) {
  depth_values[[i]] <- ggOceanMaps::get_depth(data = as.data.frame(locs[[i]]))
}
```

We have some missing data, so we are going to eliminate those
locations that do not have any depth associated.

```{r, results='hide'}
# Create a new data frame 'locs_latlong' with columns 'x', 'y', and 'depth'
locs_latlong <- list()
for(i in 1:k) {
 locs_latlong[[i]] <- data.frame(x = depth_values[[i]]$X,
                           y = depth_values[[i]]$Y,
                           depth = depth_values[[i]]$depth) 
}

# Standardize the 'depth' values in the 'locs_latlong' data frame
for(i in 1:k) {
 locs_latlong[[i]]$depth <- as.vector(scale(locs_latlong[[i]]$depth)) 
}

# Remove rows with missing values in the 'locs_latlong' data frame
for(i in 1:k) {
  locs_latlong[[i]] <- na.omit(locs_latlong[[i]])
}

# Calculate the new number of rows in the modified 'locs_latlong' data frame

for(i in 1:k) {
  n_new[[i]] <- nrow(locs_latlong[[i]])

 depth_mll[[i]] <- st_transform(depth_sf[[i]], crs = crs_vis) 
}
```

Finally, after removing all the missing data, we can update the
previously simulated locations to retain only points where we have a
corresponding depth value. We have projected the filtered locations
onto the sphere using the **fm_transform** function.

```{r}
# Transform from data.frame to sf object

# Response variable space and space-time

In this tutorial, we will fit four different scenarios: 1) a spatial
Normal response variable, 2) a spatial Bernoulli response variable, 3)
a space-time Normal response variable, and 4) a space-time Bernoulli
response variable. Therefore, we have two spatial scenarios and
another two space-time scenarios. Likewise, we will illustrate how to
fit Normal and Bernoulli distributions.

## Space-time response variables

Next, we are going to simulate the same response variables, but
including the time effect. Therefore, we will have two different
space-time datasets: one for a Normal response variable and another
one with a Bernoulli response variable.

### Normal distribution

For the normal response variable, we will use all the simulated random
fields. Subsequently, we will prepare a data.frame with the
coordinates in the sphere and values of depth and the simulated
response at those coordinates for fitting the model.

# Fit the barrier model

To begin, we define the model object using the **barrierModel.define**
function. In this step, we specify details such as the mesh, the
barrier, the PC priors for the random field hyperparameters, and the
fraction of the range when a barrier is in close proximity. This will
be the same for all the scenarios.

```{r}
# Define a barrier model using the mesh and specified prior parameters
bmodel <- barrierModel.define(
  mesh = smesh, # mesh in 3D
  barrier.triangles = triBarrier, # Barriers (world countries)
  prior.range = c(0.5, 0.1), # P(range < 0.5) = 0.1
  prior.sigma = c(1, 0.1), # P(range > 1) = 0.1
  range.fraction = 0.008 # range at the barriers 
)
```

We will fit the model using both the inla base code and inlabru. For
both approaches, it is necessary to create a data.frame containing the
three-dimensional location, depth values, and the simulated response
variable values.

## Spatial scenarios 

### Normal response variable 

#### INLABRU

We use the model formula in the inlabru way, where *field* will be the
name of the spatial effect. The main function in inlabru is **bru**,
and we just need to specify the model formula (*model*), the data
(*dataset*), and the family (*gaussian*). We also turn on the
*verbose* argument to be able to see the fitting process while it is
running.

```{r}
# Specify the model formula
model_norm <- y ~
  # Intercept
  Intercept(1) +
  # Depth linear effect
  bat(depth, model = "linear") +
  # Spatial effect
  field(cbind(x_coord,y_coord,z_coord),
        model = bmodel #The barrier model
        )

# Fit the Bayesian model using INLA
set.seed(2353)
result_norm <- bru(
    model_norm, data_model_norm_t[data_model_norm_t$time == 1,][,-1],
    family = "gaussian",
    options = list(
        verbose = TRUE,
        control.compute = list(cpo = TRUE)))
```

Once we have fitted the model, we can observe if we get back the
results. First, we check the summary of the fixed effect and the
hyperparameters.

```{r}
# Beta 0 (intercept) and Beta 1 (depth)
res_summary_fixed_rounded <- round(result_norm$summary.fixed, 2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(res_summary_fixed_rounded, caption = "Summary of the posterior distribution of fixed effects.")
```

```{r}
# Range, standard deviation (spatial effect), and standard deviation (Gaussian)
res_summary_hyper_rounded <- round(result_norm$summary.hyperpar, 2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(res_summary_hyper_rounded, caption = "Summary of the posterior distribution of hyperparameters")
```

Then, we compute the marginals of the hyperparameters: range $r$,
standard deviation of the spatial effect $\sigma$, and standard
deviation of the Gaussian distribution $\sigma_{e}$.

```{r}
# Create a list of hyperparameter marginals for visualization
pmarginals <- 
  list(
    data.frame(
      param = "sigma.e",
      inla.tmarginal(
        function(x) exp(-x/2),
        result_norm$internal.marginals.hyperpar$`Log precision for the Gaussian observations`)),
    data.frame(
      param = "range",
      inla.tmarginal(
        function(x) exp(x),
        result_norm$internal.marginals.hyperpar$`Theta1 for field`)),
    data.frame(
      param = "sigma",
      inla.tmarginal(
        function(x) exp(x),
        result_norm$internal.marginals.hyperpar$`Theta2 for field`))
  )

# Add true values and quantiles to hyperparameter marginals
pmarginals[[1]]$true <- rep(sigma_e, length(pmarginals[[1]]$x))
pmarginals[[2]]$true <- rep(ranges[1], length(pmarginals[[1]]$x))
pmarginals[[3]]$true <- rep(1, length(pmarginals[[1]]$x))
```

Likewise, we can plot the marginals for the fixed effects: intercept and depth linear coefficients.

```{r}
# Create a list of parameter marginals for visualization
fmarginals <- 
  list(
    data.frame(
      param = "intercept",
      value = result_norm$marginals.fixed$Intercept
    ),
    data.frame(
      param = "depth",
      value = result_norm$marginals.fixed$bat

#### INLA

The following code fits the model using the INLA base code. To
accomplish this, an INLA stack is initially created to model a
response variable according to a specified formula. This stack
includes a projector matrix (Alocs), spatial effect (i), depth
(beta1), and an intercept (beta0).

```{r}
# Create an INLA stack (stk) for modeling the response variable based on the specified formula and data
stk <- inla.stack(
  data = list(resp = data_model_norm_t[data_model_norm_t$time == 1,]$y), # Response variable
  A = list(Alocs_time[[1]], 1,1),  # Projector matrix
  effects = list(i = 1:bmodel$mesh$n, # Spatial effect
                 beta1 = data_model_norm_t[data_model_norm_t$time == 1,]$depth, # Depth 
                 beta0 = rep(1,nrow(data_model_norm_t[data_model_norm_t$time == 1,])) # Intercept
  ),
  tag = "est" # Estimation stack (est)
)

# Use inla to fit the specified formula and obtain the result
set.seed(52134)
result_norm <- inla(resp ~ 0 + beta0 + f(beta1, model = "linear") + f(i, model = bmodel), # Formula
            data = inla.stack.data(stk), # Stack
            control.predictor = list(A = inla.stack.A(stk),
                                     compute = TRUE),
            control.compute = list(return.marginals.predictor = TRUE),
            verbose = TRUE)

```

Once we have fitted the model, we can observe if we get back the
results. First, we check the summary of the fixed effect and the
hyperparameters.

```{r}
# Beta 0 (intercept) and Beta 1 (depth)
res_summary_fixed_rounded <- round(result_norm$summary.fixed, 2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(res_summary_fixed_rounded, caption = "Summary of the posterior distribution of fixed effects.")
```

```{r}
# Range, standard deviation (spatial effect), and standard deviation (Gaussian)
res_summary_hyper_rounded <- round(result_norm$summary.hyperpar, 2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(res_summary_hyper_rounded, caption = "Summary of the posterior distribution of hyperparameters")
```

Then, we compute the marginals of the hyperparameters: ranges $r$,
standard deviation of the spatial effect $\sigma$, and standard
deviation of the Gaussian distribution $\sigma_{e}$.

```{r}
# Create a list of parameter marginals for visualization
pmarginals <- 
  list(
    data.frame(
      param = "sigma.e",
      inla.tmarginal(
        function(x) exp(-x/2),
        result_norm$internal.marginals.hyperpar$`Log precision for the Gaussian observations`)),
    data.frame(
      param = "range",
      inla.tmarginal(
        function(x) exp(x),
        result_norm$internal.marginals.hyperpar$`Theta1 for i`)),
    data.frame(
      param = "sigma",
      inla.tmarginal(
        function(x) exp(x),
        result_norm$internal.marginals.hyperpar$`Theta2 for i`))
  )

# Add true values to parameter marginals
pmarginals[[1]]$true <- rep(sigma_e, length(pmarginals[[1]]$x))
pmarginals[[2]]$true <- rep(ranges[1], length(pmarginals[[1]]$x))
pmarginals[[3]]$true <- rep(1, length(pmarginals[[1]]$x))
```

Likewise, we can plot the marginals for the fixed parameters: intercept and depth linear coefficient.

```{r}
# Create a list of parameter marginals for visualization
fmarginals <- 
  list(
    data.frame(
      param = "intercept",
      value = result_norm$marginals.fixed$beta0
    ),
    data.frame(
      param = "depth",
      value = result_norm$marginals.fixed$beta1
    )
  )

# Add true values to parameter marginals
fmarginals[[1]]$true <- rep(beta0_norm, length(fmarginals[[1]]$value.x))
fmarginals[[2]]$true <- rep(beta1_norm, length(fmarginals[[2]]$value.y))
```

We can also visualize the predicted random field. In this case, we
compute the mean of the spatial field and also the standard deviation.

```{r}
# Add mean and standard deviation of the field to the grid 
grid_sf[[1]]$u_mean <- as.vector( # mean 
  inla.mesh.project(
      gproj, 
      result_norm$summary.random$i$mean))

grid_sf[[1]]$u_sd <- exp(as.vector( # standard deviation

#### Prediction

Another common objective with these models is to predict the response
variable in unsampled locations. Here, we share the code for
predicting with the barrier model across the Earth. Initially, we must
download the depth values for the locations we want to predict. In
this case, we'll utilize the grid previously defined for projecting
the random field.

```{r}
# Extracting latitude and longitude from the defined grid
locs_latlong_pred <- ggOceanMaps::get_depth(data = as.data.frame(st_coordinates(grid_ll[[1]])))

# Scaling the depth values and storing them in the 'depth' column
locs_latlong_pred$depth <- as.vector(scale(locs_latlong_pred$depth))
```

Next, we have to set up the stack for prediction. Here, the response
variable is defined with NA (not available), and we replicate the same
effects present in the stack for estimation but with the updated depth
values. Lastly, we merge both stacks, combining those for estimation
and prediction.

```{r}
# Create an inla.stack object for prediction
stk.pred <- inla.stack(
  data = list(resp = NA), # Placeholder for the response variable (to be predicted)
  A = list(gproj$proj$A, 1, 1), # Projection matrix for the spatial field and an intercept term
  effects = list(i = 1:bmodel$mesh$n, # Spatial random effect
                 beta1 = locs_latlong_pred$depth,
                 beta0 = rep(1, length(locs_latlong_pred$depth))), # Intercept term
  tag = "pred" # Tag for the stack, indicating it is used for prediction
)

# Combine the original stack (stk) with the prediction stack (stk.pred)
stk.full <- inla.stack(stk, stk.pred)
```

Once we have our complete stack, we can rerun the model exclusively
for prediction, utilizing the previously fitted results (adjust this
in *control.mode*).

```{r}
# Re-run the model
set.seed(52134)
res_pred <- inla(resp ~ 0 + beta0 + f(beta1, model = "linear") + f(i, model = bmodel), # Formula
                 data = inla.stack.data(stk.full), # Stack
                 control.mode = list(theta = result_norm$mode$theta, restart = FALSE), #  Utilize the theta parameters obtained from the previously estimated spde model
                 control.predictor = list(A = inla.stack.A(stk.full),
                                          compute = TRUE),
                 control.compute = list(return.marginals.predictor = TRUE),
                 verbose = TRUE)
```

In the end, we extract the predicted values from the model and
generate an sf object for visualization.

```{r}
# Extracting the values of the response variable
pred <- inla.stack.index(stk.full, "pred")$data
pred_values <- res_pred$summary.fitted.values$mean[pred]

# Creating a data frame with coordinates and predicted values
data_raster_pred <- data.frame(x = st_coordinates(grid_ll)[,1],
                               y = st_coordinates(grid_ll)[,2],
                               pred = as.vector(pred_values)
)

# Creating an sf object for visualization in Mollweide projection
data_pred <- st_as_sf(x = data_raster_pred,
                      coords = c("x","y"),
                      crs = crs_ll)

# Transforming the sf object to the desired projection
data_pred_mll <- st_transform(data_pred, crs = crs_vis)
```

### Bernouilli response variable 

We will use the same code provided for the normal response variable to
fit the Bernoulli distribution, with slight modifications to specify
the likelihood.

#### INLABRU

First, we will establish the components of the model and indicate that
our response variable follows a Bernoulli distribution.

```{r}
# Specify the model formula
model_ber <- y ~
  # Intercept
  Intercept(1) +
  # Depth linear effect
  bat(depth, model = "linear") +
  # Spatial effect
  field(cbind(x_coord,y_coord,z_coord),
        model = bmodel #The barrier model
        )

# Fit the Bayesian model using INLA
set.seed(2353)
result_ber <- bru(
    model_ber, data_model_ber_t[data_model_ber_t$time == 1,][,-1],
    family = "binomial",
    options = list(
        verbose = TRUE,
        control.compute = list(cpo = TRUE)))
```

Once we have fitted the model, we can observe if we get back the
results. First, we check the summary of the fixed effect and the
hyperparameters.

```{r}
# Beta 0 (intercept) and Beta 1 (depth)
res_summary_fixed_rounded <- round(result_ber$summary.fixed, 2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(res_summary_fixed_rounded, caption = "Summary of the posterior distribution of fixed effects.")
```

```{r}
# Range, standard deviation (spatial effect), and standard deviation (Gaussian)
res_summary_hyper_rounded <- round(result_ber$summary.hyperpar, 2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(res_summary_hyper_rounded, caption = "Summary of the posterior distribution of hyperparameters")
```

Then, we compute the marginals of the hyperparameters: ranges $r$ and
standard deviation of the spatial effect $\sigma$.

```{r}
# Create a list of parameter marginals for visualization
pmarginals <- 
  list(
    data.frame(
      param = "range",
      inla.tmarginal(
        function(x) exp(x),
        result_ber$internal.marginals.hyperpar$`Theta1 for field`)),
    data.frame(
      param = "sigma",
      inla.tmarginal(
        function(x) exp(x),
        result_ber$internal.marginals.hyperpar$`Theta2 for field`))
  )

# Add true values to parameter marginals
pmarginals[[1]]$true <- rep(ranges[1], length(pmarginals[[1]]$x))
pmarginals[[2]]$true <- rep(1, length(pmarginals[[1]]$x))
```

Likewise, we can plot the marginals for the fixed effects: intercept
and depth linear coefficients.

```{r}
# Create a list of parameter marginals for visualization
fmarginals <- 
  list(
    data.frame(
      param = "intercept",
      value = result_ber$marginals.fixed$Intercept
    ),
    data.frame(
      param = "depth",
      value = result_ber$marginals.fixed$bat
    )
  )

# Add true values to parameter marginals
fmarginals[[1]]$true <- rep(beta0_ber, length(fmarginals[[1]]$value.x))
fmarginals[[2]]$true <- rep(beta1_ber, length(fmarginals[[2]]$value.y))
```

We can also visualize the predicted random field. In this case, we
compute the mean of the spatial field and also the standard deviation.

```{r}
# Add mean and standard deviation of the field to the grid 
grid_sf[[1]]$u_mean <- as.vector( # mean 
  inla.mesh.project(
      gproj, 
      result_ber$summary.random$field$mean))

grid_sf[[1]]$u_sd <- exp(as.vector( # standard deviation
  inla.mesh.project(
    gproj, 
    log(result_ber$summary.random$field$sd))))

#### INLA

The following code fits the model using the INLA base code. To
accomplish this, an INLA stack is initially created to model a
response variable according to a specified formula. This stack
includes a projector matrix (Alocs), spatial effect (i), depth
(beta1), and an intercept (beta0).

  A = list(Alocs_time[[1]], 1,1),  # Projector matrix
  effects = list(i = 1:bmodel$mesh$n, # Spatial effect
                 beta1 = data_model_ber_t[data_model_ber_t$time == 1,]$depth, # Depth 
                 beta0 = rep(1,nrow(data_model_ber_t[data_model_ber_t$time == 1,])) # Intercept
  ),
  tag = "est" # Estimation stack (est)
)

# Use inla to fit the specified formula and obtain the result
set.seed(52134)
result_ber <- inla(resp ~ 0 + beta0 + f(beta1, model = "linear") + f(i, model = bmodel), # Formula
               data = inla.stack.data(stk), # Stack
               family = 'binomial',
               control.predictor = list(A = inla.stack.A(stk),
                                        compute = TRUE),
               control.compute = list(return.marginals.predictor = TRUE),
               verbose = TRUE)
```

Once we have fitted the model, we can observe if we get back the
results. First, we check the summary of the fixed effect and the
hyperparameters.

```{r}
# Beta 0 (intercept) and Beta 1 (depth)
res_summary_fixed_rounded <- round(result_ber$summary.fixed, 2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(res_summary_fixed_rounded, caption = "Summary of the posterior distribution of fixed effects.")
```

```{r}
# Range, standard deviation (spatial effect), and standard deviation (Gaussian)
res_summary_hyper_rounded <- round(result_ber$summary.hyperpar, 2)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(res_summary_hyper_rounded, caption = "Summary of the posterior distribution of hyperparameters")
```

Then, we compute the marginals of the hyperparameters: ranges $r$ and
standard deviation of the spatial effect $\sigma$.

```{r}
# Create a list of parameter marginals for visualization
pmarginals <- 
  list(
    data.frame(
      param = "range",

# Add true values to parameter marginals
pmarginals[[1]]$true <- rep(ranges[1], length(pmarginals[[1]]$x))
pmarginals[[2]]$true <- rep(1, length(pmarginals[[1]]$x))
```

Likewise, we can plot the marginals for the fixed effects: intercept
and depth linear coefficients.

```{r}

  list(
    data.frame(
      param = "intercept",

We can also visualize the predicted random field. In this case, we
compute the mean of the spatial field and also the standard deviation.

```{r}
# Add mean and standard deviation of the field to the grid 
grid_sf[[1]]$u_mean <- as.vector( # mean 
  inla.mesh.project(
      gproj, 
      result_ber$summary.random$i$mean))

grid_sf[[1]]$u_sd <- exp(as.vector( # standard deviation
  inla.mesh.project(
    gproj, 
    log(result_ber$summary.random$i$sd))))
```

#### Prediction

Now, we will predict the probability of presence according to the fitted model.

```{r}
# Extracting latitude and longitude from the defined grid
locs_latlong_pred <- ggOceanMaps::get_depth(data = as.data.frame(st_coordinates(grid_ll[[1]])))

# Scaling the depth values and storing them in the 'depth' column
locs_latlong_pred$depth <- as.vector(scale(locs_latlong_pred$depth))
```

Next, we have to set up the stack for prediction. Here, the response
variable is defined with NA (not available), and we replicate the same
effects present in the stack for estimation but with the updated depth
values. Lastly, we merge both stacks, combining those for estimation
and prediction.

```{r}
# Create an inla.stack object for prediction
stk.pred <- inla.stack(
  data = list(resp = NA), # Placeholder for the response variable (to be predicted)
  A = list(gproj$proj$A, 1, 1), # Projection matrix for the spatial field and an intercept term
  effects = list(i = 1:bmodel$mesh$n, # Spatial random effect
                 beta1 = locs_latlong_pred$depth,
                 beta0 = rep(1, length(locs_latlong_pred$depth))), # Intercept term
  tag = "pred" # Tag for the stack, indicating it is used for prediction
)

# Combine the original stack (stk) with the prediction stack (stk.pred)
stk.full <- inla.stack(stk, stk.pred)
```

Once we have our complete stack, we can rerun the model exclusively
for prediction, utilizing the previously fitted results (adjust this
in *control.mode*).

```{r}
# Re-run the model
set.seed(52134)
res_pred <- inla(resp ~ 0 + beta0 + f(beta1, model = "linear") + f(i, model = bmodel), # Formula
                 data = inla.stack.data(stk.full), # Stack
                 family = 'binomial',
                 control.mode = list(theta = result_ber$mode$theta, restart = FALSE), #  Utilize the theta parameters obtained from the previously estimated spde model
                 control.predictor = list(A = inla.stack.A(stk.full),
                                          compute = TRUE),
                 control.compute = list(return.marginals.predictor = TRUE),
                 verbose = TRUE)
```

In the end, we extract the predicted values from the model and
generate an sf object for visualization.

```{r}
# Extracting the values of the response variable
pred <- inla.stack.index(stk.full, "pred")$data
pred_values <- res_pred$summary.fitted.values$mean[pred]
pred_values_presences <- boot::inv.logit(pred_values)

# Creating a data frame with coordinates and predicted values
data_raster_pred <- data.frame(x = st_coordinates(grid_ll)[,1],
                               y = st_coordinates(grid_ll)[,2],
                               pred = as.vector(pred_values_presences)
)

# Creating an sf object for visualization in Mollweide projection
data_pred <- st_as_sf(x = data_raster_pred,
                      coords = c("x","y"),
                      crs = crs_ll)

# Transforming the sf object to the desired projection

## Space-time scenarios 

After fitting and predicting only in space, we are now going to
implement a separable space-time model, as illustrated in Krainski et
al., 2018. Essentially, we will include the autoregressive model of
order 1 into the spatial effect. As we did with the space examples, we
will fit two different likelihoods (Gaussian and Bernoulli). Then, as
displayed in the code, we will include an autoregressive term of order
1 with *model = "ar1"*, where the probability of the parameter $\rho$
being greater than 0 is 0.9.

```{r}
# Define formula for the space-time effect
rho.prior <- list(prior = 'pc.cor1', param = c(0, 0.9)) # P(rho>0) = 0.9
form.barrier.st_ar1 <- y ~ 0 + intercept +
  f(beta1, model = "linear") +
  f(i, model = bmodel, group = time,
    control.group = list(model = "ar1",
                         hyper = list(theta = rho.prior)))
```

### Normal response variable

The code for fitting a spatio-temporal scenario is almost the same as
in the spatial example; we just include the effect of time in the
projector matrix and also in the stack.

```{r}
# space-time projector matrix
A.st_norm_t <- inla.spde.make.A(
  mesh = smesh,
  loc = cbind(data_model_norm_t$x_coord,
              data_model_norm_t$y_coord,
              data_model_norm_t$z_coord),
  group = data_model_norm_t$time
)

# Stack data for modeling
stk.st_norm_t <- inla.stack(
  data = list(y = data_model_norm_t$y),
  A = list(A.st_norm_t,1,1),
  effects = list(
    list(i = rep(1:bmodel$f$n, k),
         time = rep(1:k, each = bmodel$f$n)),
             beta1 = data_model_norm_t$depth,
    intercept = rep(1, dim(data_model_norm_t)[1])
  )
)
```

For the fitting, we use the *inla* function and specify the family as
*"gaussian"* for this particular simulation.

```{r}
# Fit spatial-temporal model with AR1 correlation structure
result_ar1_norm <- inla(form.barrier.st_ar1,
                   data = inla.stack.data(stk.st_norm_t),
                   family = "gaussian",
                   control.predictor = list(A = inla.stack.A(stk.st_norm_t),
                                            compute = TRUE),
                   control.compute = list(return.marginals.predictor = TRUE),
                   verbose = TRUE)
```

Then, we can display the main statistical measures for the estimation
of the hyperparameters and parameters.

```{r}
# Print summary of fixed effects
res_summary_fixed_rounded <- round(result_ar1_norm$summary.fixed, 2)
knitr::kable(res_summary_fixed_rounded, caption = "Summary of the posterior distribution of fixed effects.")
```

```{r}
# Print summary of hyperparameters
res_summary_hyper_rounded <- round(result_ar1_norm$summary.hyperpar, 2)
knitr::kable(res_summary_hyper_rounded, caption = "Summary of the posterior distribution of hyperparameters")
```

We also compute the marginal distribution for the hyperparameters and
parameters, so we can compare the results obtained with the simulated
case.

```{r}
# Plot marginal posterior distributions of hyperparameters
pmarginals <- 
  list(
    data.frame(
      param = "range",
      inla.tmarginal(
        function(x) exp(x),
        result_ar1_norm$internal.marginals.hyperpar$`Theta1 for i`)),
    data.frame(
      param = "sigma",
      inla.tmarginal(
        function(x) exp(x),

      param = "sigma_e",
      inla.tmarginal(
        function(x) exp(-x/2),

    data.frame(
      param = "rho",
      inla.tmarginal(
        function(x) 1/(1+exp(-x)),
        result_ar1_norm$internal.marginals.hyperpar$`Group rho_intern for i`)),
    data.frame(
      param = "intercept",
      value = result_ar1_norm$marginals.fixed$intercept
    ),
    data.frame(
      param = "beta1",
      value = result_ar1_norm$marginals.fixed$beta1
    )
  )

# Add true values to parameter marginals

### Bernouilli response variable 

The same framework as that for the Normal response variable can be
applied to the Bernoulli response variable. We simply need to change
the family in the *inla* function to *"binomial"*. Consequently, we
obtain similar outputs, but in this case, they parameter of interest
is a probability.

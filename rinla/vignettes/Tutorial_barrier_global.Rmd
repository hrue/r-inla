# Introduction

In this tutorial, we illustrate the implementation of the barrier
model proposed in Bakka et al. (2019) in the sphere. It considers the
problem of modeling over a spatial domain, taking into account
physical barriers and the spherical shape of the Earth. Since we are
working on the global oceans, continents can be considered as physical
barriers, and this aspect has to be taken into account in the
modeling. When using a barrier model, the range is not only determined
by the distance to points. If there is a barrier between two points,
the range should decrease quickly, and the correlation over the
barrier should approach zero. Additionally, the Earth's spherical
shape is a crucial factor in this particular case, as considering a
planar approximation can bias the results when working on a global
scale. Therefore, this tutorial is developed using a projection onto a
sphere. We are using the new implementation of the INLA package.

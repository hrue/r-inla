      controlled by `try`, so that `r=try(inla(..., inla.call="remote"))`
      should work as intended.

*  Add a refine step for `parallel.linesearch`, so if this is
      enabled, then it will do a restart at the end with this option
      disabled.

*  If `control.predictor=list(compute=TRUE)` then the
      marginal densities for the linear predictor and fitted values are
      computed, but the new default is that only the summary statistics
      are returned not the marginal densities. This is because the
      storage requirement for the marginals can be substantial. The
      marginal densities can be returned setting

      treated, hopefully this new way is more robust.

  

*  New option `inla.mode`, which define how to arrange the
      internal model formulation. One of `"classic"`,
      `"twostage"` and `"experimental"`. The default is
      `"classic"`, which is unchanged behaviour compared for
      earlier versions. The other two are highly experimental for the
      moment. See `?inla`

      `cex=..` will now work

*  New shorthand feature in `inla.posterior.sample.eval`
      for extracing model components from samples
*  Added `fmesher.timeout` option, see `?inla.setOption`

*  Using a non-zero seed in `inla.posterior.sample` will
      now force serial computations.
*  A lot of internal code cleanup and improvements

# INLA 20.10.11
*  New likelihood `poisson.special1`

*  Minor code cleanup
*  Minor changes in code/doc to adapt to R-4.0

# INLA 20.09.25
*  Bug fixes and some optimisation work

# INLA 20.09.16
*  Likelihood model `sn` is redone.

*  Various minor changes.

# INLA 20.09.13
*  Model `iid` added to possible models
      for the baseline hazard in the Cox-ph model

*  Likelihood models `sn` and `sn2` have been
      replaced with a new version `sn`. The parameterisation is
      different and now done correct.

# INLA 20.09.09
*  The likelihood models `sn` and `sn2`
      are now disabled. They need a rewrite to be done right.

*  For Linux, then build so-libraries are loaded before the
      system ones. This behaviour can be reverted by setting the
      environment variable `INLA_NATIVE_LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

# INLA 20.09.07
*  Dimension for CCD integration have been
      increased from 38 to 52.

*  Default prior for the `intercept` and the `skewness` in the
      `skew-normal link` have changed. 

*  Various minor changes

# INLA 20.08.31
*  A small bug-fix with argument `-t`
*  Some improvements in the install scripts

# INLA 20.08.30
*  More work on the nested parallelism stuff

# INLA 20.08.29
*  Argument `num.threads="A"` now means
      `num.threads="A:1"`
*  Some changes for nested paralellism

# INLA 20.08.28
*  There is a minor change in `inla.qsample` and `inla.posterior.sample`.
      If argument `seed!=0` then serial mode is now forced.
      Earlier, an error would be raised if parallel mode was also requested.

*  Argument `remove.names` in `control.fixed`

*  Bug-fixes for nested parallism
*  Some optimization improvement

# INLA 20.08.24
*  Some minor fixes in the install

*  Linux builds now link with PARDISO version 7 (beta)

# INLA 20.08.22
*  MKL is now default for both Mac and Linux.
      If this cause any issues, revert back by setting
      `inla.setOption(mkl=FALSE)`.
*  As of today, the TAUCS library does not play 
      well with MKL on Mac for some reason, and this is
      silent accounted for.
      It is possible to bypass the internal check,
      and if that becomes in issue, just define
      `mkl=FALSE` as above.

*  Updated some install scripts

# INLA 20.08.21
*  Various minor fixes
*  MKL binaries are now linked with libiomp5

# INLA 20.08.19
*  Changed to the gcc-10 compiler suite for Ubuntu 1804
      and 2004.
*  Fixed an issue if the optimiser does not move
      and the use of directions
*  Minor fixes

# INLA 20.08.18
*  Code is prepared for nested parallism, which most gain
      obtained when using the PARDISO library
*  Argument `num.threads` is now in the format `A:B`,
      where A threads for the outer layer and B threads for the inner
      layer. And this applies for several functions.
*  The speed have improved, mostly when using the PARDISO
      library. Hopefully, nothing is broken.

*  likelihood `beta` now allow for cencoring near 0 and 1,
      see `inla.doc("beta", section="likelihood")`

*  Default value for `control.inla$h` is now 0.005, which
      replace the previous value of 0.01. We might change this later,
      but we have enough experience to know that 0.01 is slightly to
      large.
*  `control.inla$optimise.strategy="smart"` is now
      default. By construction, this should be both faster and more
      robust. Using `"plain"` reverts back the old behaviour. 
*  `control.inla$use.directions=TRUE` is now default. This option
      estimate numerical gradients/Hessian in directions with
      more change than for coordinate-wise directions.

# INLA 20.08.11
*  Add new experimental feature
      `control.inla=list(use.directions=TRUE/FALSE)`

# INLA 20.08.09
*  New experimental optimise strategy
      `control.inla=list(optmise.strategy="smart"`
      that is hopefully faster and as safe as the default one. Maybe
      even more safe and robust.

*  More work on the nested paralellism 

# INLA 20.08.06
*  More work on nested parallelism and some code changes
*  Code changes to reduce memory usage

# INLA 20.08.03
*  More work on nested parallelism

# INLA 20.08.02
*  Option `control.inla$lincomb.derived.only` is now disabled.

*  Testing nested parallelism `openmp.nested` with
      `num.threads="A,B"`. Work in progress

# INLA 20.07.27
*  `plot(result)` will now produce a plot of the
      `CPO/PIT` for each likelihood family (if available), instead
      of a joint plot as earlier.
*  New vignette about `jmarginal`

*  Added new likelihood models `zeroinflatedcenpoisson0`
      and `zeroinflatedcenpoisson1`
*  Link-model `sn` is updated, as well as the
      PC-prior for the skewness therein, and the added intercept model.

*  Revised the PIT calculations for family `cenpoisson`
*  Code rewrite to (try to) prevent `Inf` for `DIC` calculations
*  Minor fixed in `inla.binary.install`

*  Build-scripts fixes
*  Fix for a rare `fmesher` issue
*  Improved the code for the DIC calculations to make
      them more stable
*  Some improvment in the PC-prior for the SN-link

# INLA 20.07.12
*  Fixed `inla.link.sn` to vectorise over argument
      `a` as `sn`-package do not do that properly itself. 

# INLA 20.07.09
*  Package built with R-4.0

# INLA 20.07.04
*  Vignette added for `family=bGEV`
*  Some internal changes due to the migration to `git`

# INLA 20.06.29
*  Added `Qprior.diag` to the output when `config=TRUE`.
      The off-diagonals of this matrix are the same as `Q` in the
      same configuration, so only the diagonal of `Qprior`
      is stored.
*  Added some internal experimental code

*  PARDISO interface: internal check added
*  Fixed an wrong assert with family=bgev

# INLA 20.06.22
*  Improve some code in the PARDISO interface
*  Improved the computation of the third derivative
      in the log likelihood.

# INLA 20.06.18
*  Improved WKT support for PROJ6/GDAL3

# INLA 20.05.16
*  Support for PROJ6/RGDAL3 for handling CRS information for
        spatial objects.

# INLA 20.06.15
*  For the `intslope`-model: made all `gamma`'s
      default fixed to 1, so its similar in style the copy-feature.
*  Added argument `constr` it `inla.rjmarginal`
*  Added argument `ask` to function `inla.prune`

*  Argument `cyclic=TRUE` in `f()` should not set
            `constr=FALSE` when default is `constr=TRUE`
*  Change the `scale.model=TRUE` code for `RW1/RW2` so the
      scaling for the continous case is the same as for the discrete
      case when the locations are eqvidistant.
*  Disable link `sslogit`

# INLA 20.05.12
*  Fixed an issue with model `besag2`
*  Fixed an issue with `plot(r,plot.prior=TRUE)` for some priors

# INLA 20.05.04
*  Remove the experimental status of `inla.posterior.sample.eval`

*  Added function `inla.prune` which will remove binaries
      not supported by the running OS, to reduce the size of the
      package.
*  Added method `summary` and `print` to class
      `inla.jmarginal`

*  Add check for `NA/NaN/Inf` in mesh creation input
      ocations
*  Make sure that skewness is not to high in `inla.posterior.sample`

# INLA 20.04.18
*  Added new argument `tag` to `inla.coxph`

*  `inla.rjmarginal.eval`, to evaluate samples from a join
      approximations

*  Names of samples are now "sample:1", "sample:2", and should
      be coherent over all functions. Similar, their contents, its like
      "x:1", "x:2", etc.
*  Fixed a bug setting prior for the log baseline hazard in `inla.coxph`

# INLA 20.04.14
*  Small fix so that `result$mode$x` is written out in the
      case where `nhyper=0` and `num_threads>1`
*  Minor internal changes.

# INLA 20.04.06
*  Added link `loga`. Not yet documented.
*  First try on a new feature to more easily approximate
      the joint marginal for a subset of the latent field. This is a new
      option `selection` and corresponding `inla.rjmarginal()`
      to sample from it. 

*  Added check that `model="linear"` is not used with
      replicate or group, which is not intention.

# INLA 20.03.29
*  `MCMC` mode is now disabled

*  Skewness correction is now back as default, in 
      `inla.posterior.sample()`

*  Added family `xbinomial` that allow non-integer
      response.
*  Likelihood model `bgev` add (not yet complete), and was
      renamed from the experimental likelihood model `gev2`.

*  If `inla.call="remote"` is set,
      then `INLA:::inla.call.builtin()` is used
      if `inla.qinv()` and/or `inla.qsolve()` are
      used while constructing the model.

# INLA 20.03.17
*  Updated file `jointdataCD4.rds` in `exampledata/`

# INLA 20.03.09

      control what to do with the linear term when the `cmin` option is
      in effect
*  Added in-interval observed event in `inla.surv`

*  Added `dplyr` as suggested package as
      `dplyr::bind_rows` can replace
      `INLA::inla.rbind.data.frames`

# INLA 20.02.19
*  Added argument `E`, or `log(offset)`, to
      likelihood `gammacount`, so its equal to family `poisson`
      for `alpha=1`.

*  Minor changes

# INLA 20.01.25
*  Added a check that discrete observations are indeed
      integers, like for Poisson, Binomial, etc

*  The function `inla.binary.install` is now exported.
*  Added new likelihood family, `xpoisson`, which allows
      continous response: see the documentation for details (and note
      the error-check now done for discrete observations)

*  Added new likelihood `dgp` (discrete generalized Pareto)

*  Code clean-up (`contpoisson` and `qcontpoisson`)
*  Made `inla.pardiso.check()` a bit more informative if
      there is an error.

      `inla.coxph`
*  Fixed an issue with `NA` data in the family `gev2`

# INLA 19.12.03
*  Updated some documentation about the `pc.gevtail` prior.

      version, the new experimental version is available as
      `INLA:::inla.posterior.sample.new`
*  Error in `Epil` data-set, `y[31]` should be
      23 not 21. 

# INLA 19.11.17
*  Updated the vignette about the multinomial distribution

*  New experimental windows binary built with
  `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`, version 7.3, and linked with the
  pardiso library. Its stored in `bin/windows/experimental`

*  Updated `inla.qreordering` and updated `leuk-demo.R`
      example file (and the corresponding zip-file).

# INLA 19.11.10
*  Cache values of `qgamma` to speedup
      Gamma quantile regression

# INLA 19.10.30
*  Added a scaling constant for the precision parameter in the
      `qkumar` likelihood (to avoid instabilities). See updated
      documentation for details.

*  `inla.posterior.sample` now correct for possible skewness
      by default: see `?inla.posterior.sample` for details.

# INLA 19.10.16
*  Likelihoodmodel `betabinomialna`

# INLA 19.10.15
*  Default prior for the tail parameter in likelihood model
      `gp`, have changed to `pc.gevtail`, and the name change
      from `shape` to `tail`. It is now required to define a
      interval for the tail parameter, similar to `pc.gevtail`.

*  Code-improvement for the `loggamma`-function
*  `barrier.R` updated (minor fix and code edits)

# INLA 19.10.02

      is derived
      for `variant = 1`, which is the good parameterisation.

*  Added missing `to.theta` and `from.theta`
      functions in likelihoods `sn` and `sn2`
*  Fix some documentation in `marginal.R` (refering to the
      obsolete function `inla.marginal.transform`)

# INLA 19.05.19
*  Set `StagedInstall:no` to work around
      installation problems for MacOS and R-3.6

# INLA 19.05.17
*  The internal parameterisation of the alpha-parameter for the
  Weibull likelihood familes, has been redefined/scaled, to fix some
  optimisation issues. This means that the default prior has changed (a
  little) and user-defined priors has to change to account for this new
  internal parameterisation (sorry about that). See the documentation
  for details.

# INLA 19.05.16
*  Option `short.summary` will use a version of
      `summary` with less output, maybe more suitable for
      Markdown documents. 

# INLA 19.05.13
*  Added exampledata directory for various example datasets

*  Code cleanup and improved some input-error checking.

# INLA 19.04.16

# INLA 19.02.17
*  Fixed input-test using `inla.qsample` with
      `selection`-argument.
*  Added back `family = "normal"` which is now
      translated to `family = "gaussian"` internally.

*  More work and fixes in  `inla.merge`

# INLA 19.02.12
*  Simplied `print.inla` output

      control the RMS of the step-size for the inner optimization.
*  Changed, slightly, the initial values for the exponent in
      the Weibull likelihood models, to a value close to zero instead of
      zero.
*  New vignette about how to deal with multinomial data.

*  Added option `verbose` to
      `inla.qsample()` and `inla.posterior.sample()`

      `simplified.laplace` approximations for fixed effects and
      low-dimensional model components, and the `gaussian`
      approximation
      otherwise. The argument 
      `adaptive.max` in `control.inla`
      determines what is low-dimensional in this
      context (default 10).

*  Removed some code not used anymore

# the user's shell begins, but sometimes it is

# On SGI IRIX systems, OSTYPE is not set
# (at least in Tel-Aviv University)

# /bin/sh supplies its own politically-correct,
# string, which we need to normalize.

# If OSTYPE is still not set, we try to set it
# from uname, folding to lower case. This should sometimes
# work, but sometimes uname returns a value that is
# inconsistent with the way OSTYPE is set. For example, on
# Solaris, OSTYPE=solaris but uname returns SunOS.

# on most systems.
# If we find exceptions that cannot be fixed in a 
# generic way, we should use OSTYPE to fix the problems.
